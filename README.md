## HACKATHON HOWTO:

A Hackathon is an event where people tackle specific challenges in small groups to produce rapid results that outline issues and promising approaches to solutions. With easier access to internet, misinformation has become a challenging issue with serious repercussions in our society impacting health (Covid reality check, mask/vaccine effectiveness etc), finance (bubble detection, inflation, effect of pandemic on stockmarket, market behavior away from actual economy), media (widespread opinion without facts check via uncountable internet resources). Through this virtual Hackathon, we will focus on various problems associated with "Misinformation" that we as a society are facing nowadays and conclude on the findings in various fields based on data and analysis.   

## Tracks: 
1. Misinformation in health : Is Covid real ? Does mask / Vaccine work for covid or not etc.

2. Misinformation in finance : Information driven financial market (ex. Detecting bubble, Is the market going to crash, reddit short squeeze, Stock market behavior away from actual economy with record unemployment rate etc. )

3. Misinformation in media : Internet lies, Widespread opinion in almost every subject instead of facts (with no reasonable reference) via uncountable internet resources, Misinformation via news. 

4. You may suggest other tracks related to misinformation !

# TODO 
Within each track, there is a dedicated slack channel \#ideas for discussion of potential projects and also find teammembers.  

You do not need any specific technical expertise to participate: Although technical skills are welcome, and some of the projects will require coders and data experts, some will require writers, graphic designers, sociologists, and generally enthusiastic people willing to help!

# Event Description:

The hackathon begins with "pitches": if you have an idea this is your chance to recruit a team to work on it. To plan a hackathon project follow these rules: 

**QUESTION**: Identify the question: this should be the starting point, as for every project.

**DELIVERABLE**: Identify the deliverable in detail. The deliverable can be anything: a plot, a visualization, a web app, a code that does something specific, a dataset, or a scientific conclusion. Having a deliverable as a goal will help the team make a working plan and organize a schedule.

**SCOPE**: Make sure the deliverable and idea support drafting the project in the available time. At the end of the two day hackathon every team will have to present their work. If the project is too complex 2-days may not be enough time to make sufficient progress. However, there is no expectation that the project is release-ready in 2 days! The hackathon should serve just to jumpstart projects!

**DATA**: Make sure data and software needed are available. Inform the participants ahead of time if they will need to install or download anything. It should be allowed to join the project even if people did not do this preparation, but encourage anyone who is considering doing your project to prepare as needed. If you can, create a docker for your software - this will greatly help to avoid wasting time at the beginning of the project! If the needed data is big let the organizers know: they may be able to put it on physical drives for faster download on site.

**SKILLS**: Identify the needed skills to accomplish the project. People with the needed skills can self-identify to you as you assemble your team. 

**PITCH**: Prepare a 2 minutes presentation, your project pitch, which will be shown on the first day: in this presentation clearly state the question and its relevance, the deliverable, and the skills required. 

**TEAM**: after the pitches, every pitcher will assemble their team. People should be allowed to work on whatever they want, though you may call out for someone with a specific skill at the end of the team assembly to see if someone wants to switch team or just lend an occasional hand when needed while working on another project.
Though you do not have to, you are all encouraged to pitch an idea!! Even if you have not thought about it till the day before!
