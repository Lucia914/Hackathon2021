# TITLE : Can you differentiate FAKE NEWS from REAL NEWS ?  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
All of us may have come acorss COVID-19 related conspiracy theories (FAKE NEWS). But could we identify which news is FAKE and which one is REAL ? Could we find pattern in database that could be used as indicators to classify FAKE and REAL NEWS ? 

## DELIVERABLE: 

1. This is an open-ended problem. So, one could try to find pattern in news database (both news title and body) and report on that.

2. The pattern could be used as indicator to separate COVID conspiracy from REAL news.
