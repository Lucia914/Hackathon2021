COVID19 Fake News

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Misinformation has been on the rise since the beginning of the pandemic with regards to severity of COVID19, transmission of COVID19, and effeteness of COVID19 protocols. Our goal is to identifying fake COVID19 news articles from real COVID19 articles for the purpose to help stop the spread of misinformation. 

## DELIVERABLE: 
To achieve this goal we will build a simple model using machine learning algorithms to classify the news articles as being real or fake. Then a simple web app will be designed to allow for simple user inputed sentences to where the model with tell if they are real or not.
