# TITLE : Keylogging : How cyber attackers can monitor everything you type !  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type.

## DELIVERABLE: 

 1 : You can build a keylogger app to get the information about every keyboard stroke that takes place. 

 2 : You can also create software that detects if there’s any keylogger present in the system. This might be helpful if someone has installed a keylogger to keep an eye on every move made from the keyboard.

 3 : You must report if your app has any limitations and what could be a way to improve on the limitation(s) ?
