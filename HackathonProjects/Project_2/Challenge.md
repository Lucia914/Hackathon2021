# TITLE
Is your password strong enough ? 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
One of the basic elements of Cybersecurity is a strong password. A strong password is said to be consisting of digits, alphabets, and special symbols. You can create an app that checks the strength of the password and tells if it is safe to use or not. If the password is not safe, the app could return recommendations for strong passwords based on input. 

## DELIVERABLE: 
Build an app to check if a given password is strong ? If not recommend a strong password with minimum number of steps.  
If not, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. You could use some of the hints below : 
 1 : Insert one character to password,

 2 : Delete one character from password, or

 3 : Replace one character of password with another character. 

 4 : Is your code generalized and efficient and is able to detect any strong password ? Explain why and include all extreme cases ? Indicate the limitations if any. 

 5 : Is there anything you would recommend to make the password stronger and also to improve on the limitations ?
